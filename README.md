# Rust Workshop Learnings

Welcome to the **rust-workshop** repository, where I've compiled a collection of basic exercises and learnings from my participation in the first Rust workshop conducted by NXPxUPB in November 2022.

## Overview

Rust is a powerful and expressive language, and through this workshop, I delved into various aspects of the language. Here are some key takeaways and snippets of wisdom:

### Functions and Parameters

Rust allows us to define functions with parameters, special variables that form a function's signature. These parameters are replaced by concrete values called arguments when you invoke the function. Understanding this interplay is crucial for effective Rust programming.

### Error Handling

The main error message, "mismatched types," highlights a common issue: returning a value from a function that expects a different type. Rust suggests removing semicolons, transforming statements into expressions, to resolve this mismatch.

### Match Expressions

The `match` expression is a powerful construct in Rust. For instance, in a guessing game scenario, it efficiently handles the comparison of user guesses with a randomly generated secret number, providing clarity in code organization.

### Structs

Structs in Rust serve as templates for creating instances with specific data. Whether defining a general template or a tuple struct, structs enhance code readability by labeling and organizing data.

### If Expressions

The `if` expression facilitates conditional branching in Rust. The condition must evaluate to a boolean, and the associated block of code executes if the condition is true. Adding an optional `else` expression provides an alternative block for false conditions.
